TODO:
1. Make sponsors and donor icons clickable links. Should Roux prize be on the list?
2. Make the tile sections in "Our Solution" and "Our Vision" the same style.  Add custom icons?
3. Make the home page icon animated?
4. Add favicon icon.
5. Come up with name for the project...not Digitiz.
6. Change links to "Our tool" and "Our pilot" to be section names that make sense (i.e. #pilot)
7. Tighten the paragraphs about Mae Tao Clinic.
